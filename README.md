# README
A README for Pete

## Motivation for this document
I wanted to write down some thoughts about being a manager, what I think would be useful for team members and just have a published scratchpad. A bit like the [Manager's README](https://managerreadme.com/), but different.

## My Role
[To paraphrase](https://linearb.io/blog/being-vp-of-software-development-is-harder-than-being-ceo), I "spend most of my time translating between two groups of people in two parallel universes. I'm a citizen of both while not fully belonging to either."

## Some videos I like to reference as a manager

* [My experience with experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0na_1A_-Ebo)
* [TDD, where did it go all wrong?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ05e7EMOLM)
* [User Story Threat Modeling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hU3-33wDyAo)

## What's important to me?
For a team to be sustainable, that means [Sleep, "normal" hours and mostly stress free](https://increment.com/teams/the-epistemology-of-software-quality/). I don't like people working long hours, think presentism is a complete waste of everyone's time. 
I do buy into the idea of [Team Topologies](https://teamtopologies.com/) and that our team should be aligned to one of those team types. 
I'm very confortable with uncertainity, with experitmenting with different things and apporaches. You might not be, and that's OK. We can figure that out, but utlimate aim/goal it has to be of value to the business and our customers/audiences/whatever. Otherwise, what are we here for?

## How I think about technology
The closest framework to my own, undocumented, unarticulaed version is Emily Freeman's [Revolution Model](https://github.com/revolution-model/introduction). The major difference is, IMHO, that the model is missing a couple of factors. Teams, processes, budgets and upgrade paths. 
I know you could shoehorn some of them into the "production considerations", but I think they're too important to not call out. 

When it comes to tech strategy, I _love_ the framework from [Good Strategy/Bad Strategy](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Good-Strategy-Bad-Difference-Matters/dp/1846684811). It is very simple, what's our *real* challenge or issue, what's our guiding policy to resolve that, what coherent actions are we taking to resolve the challenege. 

## Process
Are we as a team followiing the [agile manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/)? Cool. Everything else is local company culture and scaffolding. 
Documentation is pretty important, particularly if we're in a hybrid or remote environment. We should ideally be using something like [ADRs](https://adr.github.io/). 

## Team metrics
SLOS, SLI, SLAs - awesome if we have them. If not, lets figure out what ones make sense for us, our servies, and the business we're supporting. We should know what impacts our services have upstream and downstream, and be communitating well about those.
DORA, SPACE, Rand's [Engineering Effectiveness](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nQcUspTfMQIMlmKd8S-VmMAu0sEuzvavBruq85D2-ZI) doc, all useful things to consider. But it has to be based on the reality and maturity of the business we're in. Otherwise it just becomes a [gamed metrics that the team gets beaten with](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law).
